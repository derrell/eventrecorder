# UI Event Recorder

> NOTE: this is a very simple proof-of-concept which doesn't do very much at the moment.
  
This contrib allows to record user interaction for replay during tests. It consists
of a qooxdoo contrib that records user and UI events (clicks, appearances, etc.) 
and which can be included in a qooxdoo application, and an NPM package (TBD) that
acts as a backend to replay these events during automated tests. 

It currently supports:
 - [qooxdoo unit tests](https://www.qooxdoo.org/current/pages/development/unit_testing.html)
 - [TestCafÃ©](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/test-api/) 

## Example

Minimal example:
```javascript
  var button1 = new qx.ui.form.Button("Click me", "recorder/test.png");
  var doc = this.getRoot();
  doc.add(button1, {left: 100, top: 50});

  let win = new qx.ui.window.Window("New window");
  win.set({
    width: 200,
    height: 50,
    showMinimize: false,
    showMaximize: false,
  });
  doc.add(win);

  win.addListener("appear", ()=>{
    win.center();
  });
  button1.addListener("execute", ()=>{
    win.show();
  });

  // id registration
  qx.core.Id.getInstance().register(button1,"button");
  button1.setQxObjectId("button");
  button1.addOwnedQxObject(win,"window");

  // recorder
  const controller = new cboulanger.eventrecorder.UiController();
  doc.add(controller, {right:0});
  controller.show();
```

## Demos

- [Simple event recorder demo](https://cboulanger.github.io/cboulanger.eventrecorder/): See below for how to 
  use the demo.
- [Widget Browser with event recorder](https://cboulanger.github.io/cboulanger.eventrecorder/widgetbrowser_recorder): 
  This demo shows how the event recorder is added to an existing application without changing its source code. 
- [Widget Browser with object id tooltip](https://cboulanger.github.io/cboulanger.eventrecorder/widgetbrowser_recorder):
  This demo displays the object ids which are automatically assigned to the widgets by showing a tooltip when hovering
  over them.

```bash
npm install -g qxcompiler
git clone https://github.com/cboulanger/cboulanger.eventrecorder.git
cd recorder
